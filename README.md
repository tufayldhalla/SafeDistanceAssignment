# SafeDistanceAssignment

The device that was built is called a safe distance detector. This device was built to emulate the safety mechanism employed in cars to today which alerts the driver when they are getting close to an object in front of them.

The device utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to determine the distance between it and the object in front of it. There are 3 indicators used to alert the user; the first being an LED light, the second being a speaker, and the third being an LCD display. The LCD display is an indicator of the distance between you and the object in front of you and will display messages depending on the distance. When the distance starts to become closer, the speaker will emit low beeping sounds and progressively become louder when becoming closer. Once a certain distance has been reached, the LED light will turn on to indicate the user that you have reached an unsafe distance.
